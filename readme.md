# Minimum Viable Theme for VIP

## What is this?

This is a super stripped down version of underscores with modifications. This theme implements enough to:

 - Pass the VIP Scanner tool
 - Work on VIP hosting
 - Be picked up by WordPress
 - Load a stylesheet
 - Implement a basic 404
 - Call the hooks needed for WordPress to function

And nothing more.

If you have a static design, replace what needs replacing in `index.php` and make sure `404.php` is presentable, then update style.css to match your new theme name and styling. Remember to replace screenshot.png with something nice
